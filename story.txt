Once upon a time, Dr. Mehlhase was walking her hund around Tempe. 
When suddenly, a Porshe sped by and skinnned her knees.
The Hauptrasse was full of traffic so I stayed home where there is Klimaanlage.
She really enjoyed wettbewerbsfaehig sports on television.
Watching sports on on TV means she gets to enjoy klimaanlage. 
But suddenly a team from Berlin started competing and she tossed her apfelkuchen out of her lap by accident when cheering them on.
I was driving my BMW to the Biergarten to meet some friends.
When she arrived, she ordered a Bratwurst on Brot.
She also ordered some Gebaeck from the Baeckerei.
She is the most stylish one in the Baeckerei while wearing her lederhose.  
We then held a wettbewerbsfaehig apfelkuchen eating contest.
She is so cool they should name an eltz after her. 
Not only is she stylish, the woman drives a Porsche, so get out of her way!
Rammstein started to play over the speakers. "Hey, this is my jam!", she said enthusiastically.
We swayed along to Rammstein on the jukebox.
Until she spilled the Apfelkuchen all over her lederhose.
Even though the Apfelkuchen was spilled all over she still managed to down every single bite she could find.
